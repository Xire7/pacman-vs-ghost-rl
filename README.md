# Pac-Man vs Ghost RL

Adversarial reinforcement learning project training PPO-based Pac-Man agents against DQN-based Ghost agents using the Berkeley Pac-Man game engine.

In order to run our interactive notebook:
1. CD to project/
2. Install dependencies from requirements.txt in that directory
3. Follow along in project.ipynb

The project/ directory also contains another README.txt outlining all of our used files in greater detail.
